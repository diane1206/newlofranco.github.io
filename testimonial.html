                <ul>    According to an old Indian proverb, “The best way to learn is by doing.”
                    The extension project brought varieties of learning and experiences that widened my knowledge and perspectives on how to effectively and efficiently use the computer. Learning becomes fun with my co- CAIs.
                </ul>  
                <ul> Learning how to operate a computer is a fundamental skill for educators. I was unsure whether or not to attend this training after hearing about it because Saturday was my only rest day. However, I was astounded that this program had given me a worthwhile experience that I will always cherish. Moreover, this course is really helpful and helped me gain a deeper grasp on how to use computer, which is helpful as I only knew the absolute basics. 
                    A new lesson is learned from the fundamental troubleshooting, from understanding the hardware and software and how to use it. to create graphs, charts, and grade computations using Excel. Using Slide Master to create a PowerPoint presentation was difficult at first, but once you got the hang of it, it was rewarding. Then, making a basic webpage with all those eye-twitching letters—one typo, and it will not work. In addition, Without the understanding and assistance of our very helpful and hands-on instructors, this worthwhile experience would never have been as enjoyable. Grateful for this wonderful experience.
                </ul>
                <ul>To sum this up, this extension project helped me gain valuable knowledge that I can use in my teaching and surely I will share this knowledge with other CAI’s. Thank you may not be enough but I’m really grateful to those people behind this extension project, specially to Ms. Cristine G Sagaosao.  Through this effort, I was able to broaden my knowledge on using computer.
